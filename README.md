# AoI Graph Freshness Simulator

This project explores **Age of Information (AoI)** optimization in networked systems.  
It includes simulation environments and reinforcement learning approaches for keeping information fresh on graphs.

## Structure

- **report/** — LaTeX and PDF reports (e.g., *Report 1*, results summary).  
- **notebooks/** — Google Colab notebooks implementing simulations and agents.  
  - from simple baseline heuristics to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN).  
- **artifacts/** — saved trajectories, trained models, and evaluation results.  

## Overview

We start from simplified heuristic methods (Random, Greedy, Degree-weighted) and gradually move toward **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** solutions  for various graph types (line, star, and random networks).
